                <p class="pp">Every year on May 23rd is World Turtle Day, the main purpose of celebrating World Turtle Day is to raise awareness to protect sea turtles, 
                    tortoises and their natural habitats. And we hope that through this project, people can pay more attention to, respect and understand capes and turtles.</p><br>
                    <p class="pp"> At the same time, humans are also encouraged to continue to help the survival and habitat of the oldest elves in the ocean. As a leading
                         domestic social organization dedicated to biodiversity conservation and endangered species rescue, we also actively maintain a long-term concern 
                         with BLUE RIBBON OCEAN CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION, focusing on the protection of oceans and marine species together. </p><br>
                     <p class="pp"> Such a naturalized human society will allow the coexistence of wild animals, which will delay or even stop the extinction of wild species, and preserve the original diversity of the earth. It seems that we have shared our living space, but in fact it will extend the life of civilization.
                         </p><br> 
                         <p class="pp">Our technology also supports the integration of various plant characteristics, which greatly reduces 
                        the difficulty of survival in extreme environments and reduces human dependence on the plains. More choices will also reduce population density to achieve rural urbanization. </p>
